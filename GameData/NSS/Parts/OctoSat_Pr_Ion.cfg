    description = You have no fear of getting old? Patience is your middle name? Careful planning is your motto? If so then 'Dusk' is the propulsion you need for your OctoSat. It will get you as far as you will dare to go, as slow as it's possible to get there. Don't forget your solar panels, RTG or fuel cell.
