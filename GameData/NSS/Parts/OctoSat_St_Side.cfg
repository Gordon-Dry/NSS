	description = Some say these are not really empty.. What is emptiness anyway? Is emptiness full of nothing? Does nothingness counts as something? Am I something? What is that void inside my soul? Could this module fill that void? *sigh* NSS declines all responsability for any existential crisis that could occur while pondering on the purpose of this empty or not so empty shell..
