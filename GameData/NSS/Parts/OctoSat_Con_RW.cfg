    description = It's not that advanced.. But our marketing department told us to include this term as competing manufacturers keep throwing it all over their products. So shall we do! This very advanced reaction wheel will make sure your advanced satellite can reach its advanced destination in the safest and most advanced way possible. Brilliant innit?
